In this homework assignment, we developed a Horse Herd Management System using C++.
The primary goal was to create a program that allows users to manage horses and herds efficiently.
The system supports various functionalities, including adding and removing horses and herds,
allowing horses to join or leave herds, and enabling horses to follow one another.
Overall, this homework provided hands-on experience with data structures,
object-oriented programming, and algorithm design, particularly in the context of managing complex relationships within a system.
